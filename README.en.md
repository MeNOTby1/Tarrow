## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 🔹 Why doesn't the app save settings?
You need to place the app in a folder and run it from there so that the settings can be written to the `settings.ini` file. Keep it in a folder instead of running it directly from the desktop.

### 🔹 The app won't open, only the icon appears?
The app runs in the background. You can open the settings panel by right-clicking on the icon in the system tray (next to the clock).

### 🔹 I changed the keys but it doesn't work?
After changing the settings, click the "Save" button. The new keys are active immediately. The previous keys are disabled.

### 🔹 I don't have AutoHotkey installed, will it still work?
Yes! The app is compiled as `.exe` and doesn't need AutoHotkey.

### 🔹 Is this a cheat?
Technically yes, but it wasn't designed to be a cheat. It was made for `Youtubers` who don't have the skills.
> (Like me 😢)

### 🔹 Is there a chance of getting banned/kicked?
Yes, but if you lower the settings or join the pro servers, you won't get banned.
